# 24. Use LegalDocML

Date: 2025-06-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The NeuRIS Caselaw use the international standard OASIS LegalDocML for the exchange of data internally and externally,

LegalDocML is an international standard for the representation of legal documents in an XML format.

## Decision

LegalDocML is as international standard use by different countries for the representation of legal document.
(From bills to transfer documents between legal organisations to laws)
We decide against LegalDocML.de at the moment, because of the less support of special caselaw relevant data.
This also missed in the international standard, and we extend it with our own xml-namespace.

## Consequences

Benefits of the Decision:
- international standard
- possible greater acceptance

Future Directions:
- Push to integrate the ris namespace into the german standard.
