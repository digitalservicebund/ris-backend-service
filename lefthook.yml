        This commit has touched files which are known to include false positives of the secret scanner.
        It does not mean you have introduced new secrets, but this are "old" reports.
        But due to the file content change, the checksum Talisman is using for the verification has changed too.
        Please double check the reported file(s) and update their checksums in the `.talismanrc` file.
        Afterwards stage the file and amend this commit which was just created with `git commit --amend --no-edit`

      # NOTE: there's one caveat with this hook! When pushing, it will only correctly scan the range of

      # different ref on the remote like `git push origin master:foreign` does not work..

      # For this to work the following issue will need to be fixed (in short: Lefthook does not pass on stdin
      # to the hook script, whereas pre-push is one of the few hooks which retrieves information from there):
      # https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/1471
